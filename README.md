# BrainQuest - Futuristic Quiz Game

BrainQuest is a cutting-edge, immersive quiz game designed to challenge and enhance cognitive abilities. Unlike traditional quiz platforms, BrainQuest features a sci-fi inspired interface with adaptive difficulty, real-time feedback, and gamified elements to create an engaging brain training experience.

## Features

- **Futuristic UI/UX**: Dark mode with neon accents, cyber grid backgrounds, and neural-inspired design elements
- **Multiple Challenge Types**:
  - Quick Challenge: General knowledge questions with time pressure
  - Memory Matrix: Visual pattern recognition and sequence memorization
  - Logic Circuit: Problem solving and logical reasoning
  - Speed Synapse: Reaction time and rapid decision making
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Questions adjust based on user performance
- **Cognitive Profile System**: Users select a neural avatar and cognitive profile that influences their experience
- **Progress Tracking**: XP system, levels, daily streaks, and achievements
- **Sound Effects**: Custom audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers and UI interactions
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Number keys (1-4) for answering, Space to continue, Escape to pause
